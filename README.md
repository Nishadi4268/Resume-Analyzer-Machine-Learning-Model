# ResumeScorePro: Enhancing Your Career Potential

# Introduction
Field of Project: Human Resources (HR) and Recruitment

Problem: Traditional resume screening is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to prejudice, 
making effective applicant selection difficult and potentially neglecting qualified candidates.

Importance: The Resume Analyzer and Rating System project is critical for 
automating and standardizing the hiring process, addressing the inefficiencies of human resume analysis. 
It increases the quality of applicant evaluations by introducing objectivity and specific criteria, enabling fair and data-driven decision-making. 
The project addresses the need for streamlined recruiting methods to improve overall hiring efficiency and provide a more transparent 
and equitable experience for both companies and job seekers.

# Defining the ML Problem
Task: Train and develop an ML model for use in future cases and integrate it into a resume analyzer.

Experience: Utilize a dataset containing resume information, including features such as education, skills, and work experience, 
to train and test the NLP algorithms. The machine learning model should be able to catch the patterns and relationships using past experience historical data.

Performance Measure: Evaluate the algorithm's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, 
and F1 score to assess the effectiveness of resume scoring and recommendation generation.

# Data
Data Source: Kaggle Resume Dataset

Columns: 2 (category, Resume)

Rows: 963

# Algorithm
Selected Algorithms:
  Random Forest
  Support Vector Machines (SVM)

# Implementation
Pre-processing: A thorough pre-processing stage was carried out to ensure the quality and efficacy of our machine learning models. 
Techniques included data preprocessing and text preprocessing to remove duplicates, null values, punctuation, uppercase, numbers, and special symbols.

## Algorithm Performance:

# SVM Algorithm:

Training Scores:
  Accuracy = 1.0
  Precision = 1.0
  Recall = 1.0
  F1-score = 1.0
  Test Scores:
  Accuracy = 0.735
  Precision = 0.733
  Recall = 0.957
  F1-score = 0.83
  
Random Forest Algorithm:
  Training Scores:
  Accuracy = 1.0
  Precision = 1.0
  Recall = 1.0
  F1-score = 1.0
  Test Scores:
  Accuracy = 0.735
  Precision = 0.733
  Recall = 0.957
  F1-score = 0.83

# Conclusion: 
ResumeScorePro marks a substantial development in automating and standardizing resume analysis for better recruiting procedures. 
Despite overfitting issues, the use of SVM and Random Forest algorithms demonstrates the possibility of revolutionary effects on the recruiting scene.
